# First Static Site

I made this after watching the web design for beginners course by Brad Schiff
[on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/web-design-for-beginners-real-world-coding-in-html-css/).

The deviations I took from the course were the following:

1. I used Bootstrap 4.1.3, mostly as a HTML reset
2. I used Font Awesome for social links
3. I used flexbox instead of floats+clearfix because when I casually came across
   the concept a year or two ago it made a lot more sense to me.
4. I used ems and rems instead of pixels wherever possible, although I do need
   to clean up this part of the code.

For now there's a simple home page and nothing more.
