# WebDev Playground

So it all started on the 9th of September, 2018. Out of sheer frustration I
posted [a tweet](https://twitter.com/wingedrhino/status/1038856651711959042)
about how I'd rather be publicly shamed than not know enough HTML/CSS to
reproduce all elements needed for a site equivalent to my current (at the time
of writing this tweet) [WordPress site](https://wingedrhino.com).

This repository is to capture my learning process as I go about building this
site.

I'd be happy if I just have a bunch of static pages that look clean, consistent
and modern.

Eventually I intend to also figure out other stuff like a couple of frontend
frameworks (I'm eyeing [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) most keenly) and maybe write
a simple CMS-like app in Go that would power a basic site.
